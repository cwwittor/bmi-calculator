        <h3>What your BMI result means</h3>
        <p>
          A BMI range of 18.5 to 24.9 is considered a'healthy weight.'
          Maintaining a healthy weight may lower your chances of experiencing
          health issues later on, such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. Aim for a
          nutritious diet with reduced fat and sugar content, incorporating
          ample fruits and vegetables. Additionally, strive for regular physical
          activity, ideally about 30 minutes daily for five days a week.

      <h3>Limitations of BMI</h3>
      <p>
        Although BMI is often a practical indicator of healthy weight, it is not
        suited for every person. Specific groups should carefully consider their
        BMI outcomes, and in certain cases, the measurement may not be
        beneficial to use.

        <span>Gender</span>
        <p>
          The development and body fat composition of girls and boys vary with
          age. Consequently, a child's age and gender are considered when
          evaluating their BMI.

        <span>Age</span>
        <p>
          In aging individuals, increased body fat and muscle loss may cause BMI
          to underestimate body fat content.

        <span>Muscle</span>
        <p>
          BMI may misclassify muscular individuals as overweight or obese, as it
          doesn't differentiate muscle from fat.

        <p>
          Expectant mothers experience weight gain due to their growing baby.
          Maintaining a healthy pre-pregnancy BMI is advisable to minimise
          health risks for both mother and child.

        <p>
          Certain health concerns may affect individuals of some Black and Asian
          origins at lower BMIs than others. To learn more, it is advised to
          discuss this with your GP or practice nurse.
