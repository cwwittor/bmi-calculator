## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I wasn't really happy with my results in this project. It both felt like it took me twice as long as previous ones, as well as it feels like I just did a very poor job at planning/setup to where I had to rewrite a good bit.

I have learned that in a lot of cases it is probably better to reuse similar paragraph styling in multiple parts unless it is at a very small scale, ran into problems when I had used the same subtext class in multiple places but had to change it differently once I upped viewports.

I have learned the initial setup and planning of divs is very important, had to reformat a bit once I hit desktop size.

I have learned more about color gradients in css.

### Continued development

I think the thing I want to work on more with my next project is the initial setup and planning of how things are going to be connected. Just planning in general is a need since I feel like more structure and less tedious structure would help my next project.

### Useful resources

- For this project I mainly used w3 schools and raycast
